# Conclusion: The Orbitalis Project
See the live project: [http://djambo.github.io/theorbitalisproject](http://djambo.github.io/theorbitalisproject)

Final collaborative project for [Ryan Berkey's Generative Art &amp; Creative Code class](https://github.com/rybotron/wnm498genart_f14/wiki) by [Gianluca Martini](http://gianlucamartini.me/), [Hugo Baeta](http://hugobaeta.com), and [June Jiwoong Kim](http://junejk.com/)

## Project Overview
We're approaching the idea of conclusion through a mix of data visualization and user input. We'll visualize the live position of all satellites orbiting earth for a period of time. We're getting out data from the [NASA satellites website](http://science.nasa.gov/iSat/iSAT-text-only/) using three.js to place the satellites around our earth object and define their trajectory. Every time the user loads the website, the coordinates will be different and taken from the live data. The user can interact with the piece by tapping a satellite, effectively making it start drawing a path on it's trajectory. The user will essencially define what completion means by deciding when the drawing is complete. In the end this can be exported as a 3D file for 3D printing of this piece - a trully interactive sculpture.

## Deliverables
- [Website working off of github's gh-pages branch](http://djambo.github.io/theorbitalisproject)
- Export of 3D OBJ files of the drawing
